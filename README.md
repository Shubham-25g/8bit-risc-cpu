#  8-bit Pipelined RISC CPU — Verilog Project

A custom-designed 8-bit RISC CPU core implemented in Verilog, featuring a simple 2-stage pipeline, ALU, register file, ROM, and hazard-free control flow.

Designed and simulated for educational purposes to demonstrate core CPU architecture concepts, digital design skills, and RTL verification.

## Key Highlights

* 8-bit RISC-style architecture with minimal instruction set
* 2-stage instruction pipeline: Fetch & Execute
* Custom ALU & Register File modules
* ROM for instruction storage and PC flow
* Hazard-free instruction execution
* Verified using Icarus Verilog & GTKWave
* Testbenches for functional verification
